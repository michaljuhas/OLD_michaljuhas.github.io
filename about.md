As a CTO and co-founder of [HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com), I am responsible for product development and IT.

I'm passionate about:

* Startups
* Productivity
* Personal Growth
* Product Management
* Software Development
* Internet of Things

Back in Europe, I co-founded a start-up BookFan which won a national contest _Idea of The Year 2011_ and created a community of book lovers with 200k MAU.

I was also working as an IT consultant for four years, mostly building data warehouses for banks and insurance companies. Since then I'm passionate about big data & data analysis, too!

As a passionate [Toastmaster](http://www.toastmasters.org/), I was a leader of [Bohemian Toastmasters](http://bohemiantoastmasters.org/) where I took almost all roles including the Club President. I also co-founded a new club [Prague Business Toastmasters](http://www.praguebusinesstoastmasters.com) and organized many events, including [Toastmasters Residential Weekend 2014](http://www.praguetoastmasters.cz/residential-weekend) for 100+ people.
