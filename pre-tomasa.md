    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    
    <p>I'd like to support your desire to get connected to the best CEOs out there. What can be better than to have some <b>boutique</b> community of the most inspiring CEOs? :)</p>
    
    <p>Go ahead: <a href="http://ceo.community/">http://ceo.community/</a>

    <p>If you want to experiment later on, I can help you set up some dedicated Slack channel, membership site, etc.</p>
