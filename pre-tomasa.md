    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    
    <p>I'd like to support your desire to get connected to the best CEOs out there.</p>
    
    <p>What can be better than to lead a <b>boutique</b> community of the most inspiring CEOs? :)</p>
    
    <p>You can start reaching out to the TOP CEOs asking them <i>Hey, I've got a private community, wanna join?</i> :-)</p>
    
    <p>Go ahead: <a href="http://ceo.community/">http://ceo.community/</a> Your admin username is <b>tomas.laboutka</b> and password <b>uheAPwWalg4zy4</b>. You can administer it on <a href="http://ceo.community/wp-admin/">http://ceo.community/wp-admin/</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Email <a href="tomas@ceo.community">tomas@ceo.community</a> is redirected to your gmail account.</p>

    <p>If you want to experiment later on, I can help you set up some dedicated Slack channel, membership site, etc.</p>
