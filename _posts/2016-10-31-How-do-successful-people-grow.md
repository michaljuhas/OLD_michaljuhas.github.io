I just finished reading [How Successful People Grow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18453291-how-successful-people-grow) from John Maxwell.

It was a quick read with several good & deep thoughts. In short, these are the topics covered & take-aways:

1. **Become an Intentional Learner:** Growth Doesn’t Just Happen
2. **Develop Self-Awareness:** You Must Know Yourself to Grow Yourself
3. **Believe in Yourself:** You Must See Value in Yourself to Add Value to Yourself
4. **Set Aside Time to Reflect:** Learning to Pause Allows Growth to Catch Up with You

5. **Embrace Discipline Daily:** Motivation Gets You Going, Discipline Keeps You Growing
6. **Seek Out a Positive Environment:** Growth Thrives in Conducive Surroundings
7. **Become Highly Strategic:** To Maximize Growth, Develop Strategies
8. **Turn Negatives into Positives:** Good Management of Bad Experiences Leads to Great Growth
9. **Grow from the Inside Out:** Character Growth Determines the Height of Your Personal Growth
10. **Get Used to Stretching Yourself:** Growth Stops When You Lose the Tension Between Where You Are and Where You Could Be
11. **Make Smart Trade-Offs:** You Have to Give Up to Grow Up
12. **Learn to Ask More Questions:** Growth Is Stimulated by Asking Why?
13. **Find a Good Mentor:** It’s Hard to Improve When You Have No One but Yourself to Follow
14. **Focus on Enlarging Your Potential:** Growth Always Increases Your Capacity
15. **Help Others Reach Their Potential:** Growing Yourself Enables You to Grow Others

And a few interesting & inspiring quotes:

> The people who grow and achieve the most are the ones who harness the power of patience and persistence.

> What does it take to develop consistency? A system and the discipline to follow through.

> You cannot change your life until you change something you do every day. If you keep learning and growing every day over the course of many years, you will be astounded by how far it will take you.

> Become your own encourager, your own cheerleader. Every time you do a good job, don’t just let it pass; give yourself a compliment.

> Make a list of all of your best personal qualities. If you have positive self-esteem, then this will probably be easy for you. If you don’t, you may need to spend days or weeks creating the list. Don’t stop until you have written a hundred positive things about yourself and then spend time every day reading the list to remind yourself of your value. Using the list as a springboard, decide on the one word that best describes you.

> Having a beginner’s mind-set means wondering why and asking a lot of questions until you get answers.

> One of the best ways to remain curious is to begin each day with a determination to learn something new, experience something different, or meet someone you don’t already know.
