The end of recruiting from campuses

4. The end of recruiting from campuses. Like health care, education is an area rife with "bloated, rising costs, incredibly unchecked by anyone," Forrester's McQuivey says. In response, more current and future members of the work force are "ridding themselves of the need to use the current systems," he says. In other words: You don't have to go to college to prove yourself as a programmer. Instead, you can save time and money by taking online courses.
And that's just one industry. Although Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been around for more than a decade, they continue to gain momentum as an alternative to the pricier and more time-consuming coursework of traditional education. While it's an exaggeration (at least at this point) to say that the MOOC trend will render obsolete the prestige and connections that come from, say, earning an MBA the old-fashioned way, there's no question online courses are already saving time and money for both students and businesses.
Goldman Sachs, for example, has partnered with MOOC provider Udemy to train and bring on board new hires. "From the firm's perspective, we can customize content based on what they already know and measure their progress, as well as the program's impact," Jason Wingard, Goldman Sachs's chief learning officer, wrote on Inc.com. "And when they finally do arrive on campus for orientation, participants are better prepared and thus start on a more level playing field."
