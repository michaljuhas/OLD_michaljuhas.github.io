Gartner published the [Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2017](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2016/10/26/gartners-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2017/#232876657044), here's a quick digest:

## Artificial Intelligence & Advanced Machine Learning

AI is an intelligent system that learns, understands, adapts and potentially operates autonomously. It includes technologies such as

* deep learning
* neural networks
* and natural-language processing

## Intelligent Apps

Intelligent apps, which include technologies like virtual personal assistants (VPAs), have the potential to transform the workplace by making everyday tasks easier and its users more effective.

## Intelligent Things

New intelligent things generally fall into three categories:

* robots
* drones
* and autonomous vehicles

Existing things including Internet of Things (IoT) devices will become intelligent things delivering the power of AI enabled systems everywhere including the home, office, factory floor, and medical facility.

## Virtual & Augmented Reality

VR and AR transform the way individuals interact with each other and with software systems creating an immersive environment.

* VR can be used for training scenarios and remote experiences
* AR enables businesses overlay graphics onto real-world objects, such as hidden wires on the image of a wall

Over time AR and VR expand beyond visual immersion to include all human senses.

## Digital Twin

A digital twin is a dynamic software model of a physical thing or system. It can be used to analyze and simulate real world conditions, responds to changes, improve operations and add value.

## Blockchain

It adds trust to untrusted environments and reduce business friction by providing transparent access to the information in the chain.

## Conversational Systems

Conversational systems enable people and machines to use multiple modalities (e.g., sight, sound, tactile, etc.) to communicate across the digital device mesh (e.g., sensors, appliances, IoT systems).

## Mesh App and Service Architecture

The mesh app and service architecture is a multichannel solution architecture that leverages cloud and serverless computing, containers and microservices as well as APIs and events to deliver modular, flexible and dynamic solutions.

## Digital Technology Platforms

Every organization will have some mix of five digital technology platforms:

* information systems
* customer experience
* analytics and intelligence
* the IoT
* and business ecosystems

Especially with a focus on new platforms and services for IoT, AI and conversational systems.

## Adaptive Security Architecture

Security in the IoT environment is particularly challenging. The evolution of the intelligent digital mesh and digital technology platforms and application architectures means that security has to become fluid and adaptive.
