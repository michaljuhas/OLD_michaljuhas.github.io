Virtual assistants

While AI will infuse everything, from cloud services to Internet of Things, there's one area that will really grow intelligent in 2017: virtual assistants.

While Siri, Cortana and Google Now are not exactly new, such services are being stitched into more areas.

For instance, Apple finally opened Siri up to third-party developers in 2016, so you can now tell Siri to send a payment to someone via Venmo. You can use Cortana (via Windows 10) with a bunch of Microsoft Office apps, too.
