* **Rely on user feedback**: listen to feedback from those around us (co-workers, friends, family) to identify areas for self-improvement.
* **Set deadlines**: set your own deadlines for self-improvement. Goal setting is a crucial element in both product and personal improvement.
* **Identify unique differentiators**: identify what no one else in your company is doing and then build the skills and expertise to help your company succeed in that area.
* **Go agile** - take small steps toward your goal, one after the other, to ensure that you will get there eventually.
