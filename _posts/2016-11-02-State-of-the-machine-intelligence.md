2 very interesting articles about the machine learning:

1. **Part 1:** [Humanity’s Extinction Event Is Coming](https://medium.com/the-mission/humanitys-extinction-event-is-coming-c0f84f1803f)
2. **Part 2:** [Self-Driving Cars are Hurtling Towards an AI Brick Wall](https://medium.com/the-mission/self-driving-cars-are-hurtling-towards-an-ai-brick-wall-932e16bd7777)

Shivon Zillis elaborates in her outstanding collection of articles [The Current State of Machine Intelligence 2.0](http://www.shivonzilis.com/machineintelligence) on how the machine intelligence technologies will transform the business world. From health-care, through agriculture, to financial services... very interesting reading, check it out!
