Gartner published recently the [Top 10 Technology Trends for 2016](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2016/01/15/top-10-technology-trends-for-2016/). Here's a digest of the interesting ones

## The Device Mesh

There's a shift from desktop, laptop and smart phone to wearable devices, augmented and eventually virtual reality.

## 3D-Printing Materials

Recent advances make it possible to mix multiple materials together with traditional 3D printing in one build. This could be useful for field operations or repairs when a specific tool is required and printed on demand.

## Information of Everything

Everything surrounding us in is producing, using and communicating with virtually unmeasurable amounts of information.

## Advanced Machine Learning

Advanced machine learning is what makes smart machines appear "intelligent" by enabling them to both understand concepts in the environment, and also to learn.

## Autonomous Agents and Things

Advanced machine learning gives rise to a spectrum of smart machine implementations — including robots, autonomous vehicles, virtual personal assistants (VPAs) and smart advisors — that act in an autonomous manner.

## Adaptive Security Architecture

The complexities of digital business and the algorithmic economy, combined with an emerging "hacker industry," significantly increase the threat surface for an organization.

## Advanced System Architecture

The smart machines require intense computing architecture demands to make them viable for organizations. They’ll get this added boost from ultra-efficient architectures.

## Internet of Things Architecture and Platforms

IoT platforms exist behind the mesh app and service architecture. The technologies and standards in the IoT platform form a base set of capabilities for communicating, controlling, managing and securing endpoints in the IoT. The platforms aggregate data from endpoints behind the scenes from an architectural and a technology standpoint to make the IoT a reality.
