<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="/" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>As a CTO and co-founder of HotelQuickly I am responsible for product development and customer service. In the Product & Engineering team we have ~25 people and <a href="https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/">»WE ARE HIRING!«</a>.</p>

<p>Back in Europe I co-founded a start-up which won a national contest called "Idea of The Year" and created a big community of book lovers. We had about 200.000 monthly visitors back then. Prior to that I was working as an IT consultant for about 4 years, mostly building data warehouse for banks and insurance companies.</p>

<p>While being a Toastmaster for almost 4 years back in Prague, I was a passionate leader of Bohemian Toastmasters (taking almost all roles including Club President), co-founded a new club in Prague (Prague Business Toastmasters) and also organized events like Toastmasters Residential Weekend for ~100 people.</p>
